# deviant_detection_RNN
MSC project reproducing fMRI data with RNN

## We are trying to reproduce the fMRI data from this paper:

Alejandro Tabas, Glad Mihai, Stefan Kiebel, Robert Trampel, Katharina von Kriegstein (2020) Abstract rules drive adaptation in the subcortical sensory pathway eLife 9:e64501

For now the point is to train the RNN to detect where the deviant is.
